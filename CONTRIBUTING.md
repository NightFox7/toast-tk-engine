# How to contribute

Toast TK is a young open source project.
We are looking for passionates, helpful individuals and volunteers to contribute in every single bit of this project: from the website through the documentation to the very core of the application.
So, if you like open-source projects and would like to give back some help, we'd like to see your contributions!
It doesn't matter how familiar you are with test automation applications, or whether you know how to write programs for Java. There are plenty of ways to be helpful! One of the first things you should do is actually use Toast TK, and get to know it - read about it, evangelise it, and engage with the wider community.
If you'd like to help, get in touch and let us know how you'd like to help. We love contributors!!

# Getting Started

If you want to contribute but do not know where to start, filter issues with the label `up-for-grabs`. These issues are easy enough to do for someone discovering the project.

If you found a bug, submit a ticket for your issue on the Github project, assuming one does not already exist.
Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
